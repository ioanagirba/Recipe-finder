Ingredients
5 pounds potatoes
2 large cloves garlic, minced
fine sea salt
6 tablespoons butter
1 cup whole milk
4 ounces cream cheese, room temperature
Toppings: chopped fresh chives or green onions, freshly-cracked black pepper


Instructions
1. Cut the potatoes. Feel free to peel your potatoes or leave the skins on. Then cut your potatoes into evenly-sized chunks, about an inch or so thick.
2. Boil the potatoes. Add garlic and salt to the water and bring to a boil. Boil for 10-12 minutes, then drain.
3. Prepare the butter mixture. Heat butter, milk, and salt together until melted.
4. Pan-dry the potatoes. Return the potatoes to the hot stockpot and shake gently on low heat to remove steam.
5. Mash the potatoes. Mash to your desired consistency.
6. Stir everything together. Add butter and cream cheese in stages, folding gently.
7. Taste and season. Add extra salt and pepper if needed.
8. Serve warm. Garnish and enjoy!
